1. Slicing :
SELECT *
FROM call_center
WHERE YEAR(call_timestamp) = 2020
AND state = 'Texas';

2. Dicing :
SELECT *
FROM call_center
WHERE YEAR(call_timestamp) = 2020
AND state IN ('Florida', 'Texas')
AND reason IN ('Payments')
AND sentiment IN('Positive' );

3. Roll up :
SELECT
YEAR(call_timestamp) AS Year,
MONTH(call_timestamp) AS Month,
COUNT(id) AS MonthlyCalls
FROM call_center
WHERE YEAR(call_timestamp) = 2020
GROUP BY Year, Month;

4. Drill down :
SELECT
YEAR(call_timestamp) AS Year,
MONTH(call_timestamp) AS Month,
DAY(call_timestamp) AS Day,
COUNT(id) AS DailyCalls
FROM call_center
WHERE YEAR(call_timestamp) = 2020 AND MONTH(call_timestamp) = 10
GROUP BY Year, Month, Day;

5. Pivot :
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Florida' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS
FloridaCalls,
SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Texas' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TexasCalls,
SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'Michigan' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS
MichiganCalls
FROM call_center
WHERE YEAR(call_timestamp) = 2020;
